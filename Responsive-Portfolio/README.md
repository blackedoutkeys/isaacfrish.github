Bootstrap - Responsive Portfolio


Completed Porfolio Project

#Overview:

A complete portfolio for my entirety of work including pre-pandemic work experience is contained within. A master stylesheet and notes are made throughout to explain everything for the multiple pages of HTML.

By using external sources such as Bootstrap, the efficiency of buidling websites increases exponentially and creates a way for a client to have full accessibility and customization options while having the basic framework put in place for them. 


##Project Includes:

*Full Portfolio
*About Me Anchor/Site
*External Links to Personal/Professional Social Media
*Contact Form
*Use of Bootstrap
