Javascript Passowrd Generator

Completed Javascript Passowrd Generator Project

#Overview:

This password generator was made to help users create complex passwords for personal and business usage. When you load into the site, you are prompted with a large clickable button. Once clicked, it will prompt the user and ask how long the password should be. As long as they choose between 8-128 characters, it will move into four confirmation prompts. Then the password will populate in the large box above the button, which can be copied and pasted into whatever app the user chooses. 


##Project Includes:

*Fully functional passowrd generator
*Five total prompts
*One error messsage prompt if user doesn't choose appropriate length
*Complex password 
*For backend users, you will also see the arrays and random generation of characters as the function moves through its steps
